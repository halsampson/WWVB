Experimental testing of WWVB decoding using audio card at ~192kHz
(For now, SampleHz should be measured precisely from 1PPS recording; TODO: auto-adjust)

Antenna is shielded magnetic field loop as large as possible (now ~2 sq meters) orthogonal to Ft. Collins
with capacitor chosen for ~60kHz resonance. Q as large as possible (now < 10)

Signal fed through 1:20 transformer from dead small switching power supply to boost voltage to sound card
mic input mic with boost set to +30 dB

Works best around 4:00am on West coast (see SNR dB readings in 3-5am.txt)

Also works with a few errors during the day, but interference just after sunset is high.
